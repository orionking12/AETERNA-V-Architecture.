## 🌌 Executive Summary: The Ontological Leap

**AETERNA-V** (formerly Gen-5) represents the transition from probabilistic generative models (which "guess" pixels) to **World State Simulation Models**.

Unlike current architectures (Transformers, Latent Diffusion) that suffer from quadratic complexity $O(N^2)$ and "amnesia" in long sequences, AETERNA-V utilizes **Selective State Space Models (SSM)** with linear complexity $O(N)$. This enables the generation of "Persistent Reality": objects, physics, and audio that maintain infinite coherence over time.

## 🏛️ Architecture Pillars

### A. The ISOCHRON Kernel (Infinite Memory)
Replacement of the Attention mechanism with a **Selective Scan Kernel**.
* **Principle:** Discretization of a continuous signal using transition matrices ($\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \Delta$).
* **Advantage:** The hidden state $h_t$ updates recurrently, allowing a 1-hour video context to occupy the same VRAM as 1 second. Optimized for **Google Cloud TPUs**.

### B. RESONANCE Fusion (Phase Sync)
Current models generate video and audio separately. RESONANCE uses **Phase-Locking**.
* **Mechanism:** The audio spectrogram acts as a physical constraint for pixel movement. If there is no sound vibration, there is no visual motion.

### C. LOGOS Protocol (Physics Guard)
**Critical Optimization:** We abandoned simple linear verification. The new module calculates the **Kinetic and Potential Energy** of latent states.
* **Function:** If the generation violates the conservation of energy (Newtonian/Thermodynamics), the tensor is rejected before rendering.

## ⚡ Infrastructure Alignment

This architecture is designed to be native to the **Google Cloud Vertex AI** ecosystem.
* **Compute:** Optimized for TPU v5p using JAX/XLA compilation.
* **Orchestration:** Designed to integrate with Gemini 1.5 Pro for multimodal reasoning.
